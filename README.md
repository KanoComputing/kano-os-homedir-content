## Kano OS Home Directory Content

This repository collects some exciting content for users.
Upon installation, newly created Kano users will have this content available on their home directory.

The content files will be copied via the skeleton directory structure `/etc/skel`,
providing an independent copy for every user that they can view, modify and overwrite independently.
